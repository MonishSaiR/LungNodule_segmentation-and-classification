## Preprocessing

The Preprocessing part was taken from [Data science bowl](https://www.kaggle.com/c/data-science-bowl-2017#tutorial) and from [here](https://github.com/jaeho3690/LIDC-IDRI-Preprocessing).
Before Preprocessing, it is important to configure PyLIDC as specified [here](https://pylidc.github.io/install.html). Perform the Preprocessing steps as mentioned in the github above

## Segmentation
After the preprocessing is done use the numpy files to load onto the segmentation model

## Classification
After the preprocessing is done use the numpy files to load onto the Classification model
